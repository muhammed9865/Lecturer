# Lecturer
In Lecturer, I'm trying to ease the access to my college (Computer Science) lectures and sections.

Techniques used:
 1- MVVM for the design pattern along with Livedata
 2- Coroutines for the multi-threading
 3- Fragments
 4- Authentication with google using Firebase Auth
 5- Database using Firebase Firestore database
 
 UI Components
 1- Bottom Navigation for traversing through the fragments
 2- Custom Toolbars
 3- Navigation graph for a structured navigation.
 4- Glide to load images
 5- Exoplayer as a Mediaplayer for the lectures/sections
 6- Material Components
 7- Intuit for resolutions responsiveness
